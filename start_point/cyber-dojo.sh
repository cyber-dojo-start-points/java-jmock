# Each [test] press starts two JVMs, one to compile and one to run the tests,
# and starting them is most of the wait rather than a part of it. The image holds
# an AOT cache for each, recorded when it was built, holding the classes that JVM
# loads in the form the JVM wants them; reading one back costs a fraction of
# loading them again. There is one cache per JVM because a cache is validated
# against the classpath of the JVM reading it, and these two have nothing in
# common. Nothing is lost when a cache is missing or unusable: the JVM says so
# and loads the classes itself, and the run is only slower.
#
# Your own classes are in neither cache, so editing them cannot invalidate one.
# javac's options are spelled -J here because that is how javac passes an option
# to the JVM running it rather than to the compiler.
#
# The collector is named rather than left to the JVM to choose. Replaying an AOT
# cache under the collector it picks by default crashes it outright, often enough
# to see in a handful of runs, and a JVM that lives for a fraction of a second
# has nothing to gain from a concurrent collector in any case.
